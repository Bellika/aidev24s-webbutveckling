        "*As you step cautiously into the dimly lit chamber of the fortress, your eyes fall upon a peculiar figure stationed by an ancient wooden door. The figure is a wizened old man, draped in tattered robes that whisper softly against the stone floor. His eyes, though clouded, seem to pierce through the gloom with unnerving clarity. He raises a gnarled finger, pointing directly at you.*\n\n\"Ah, Kalle Carlsten, the righteous Paladin! I have awaited your arrival. The darkness festers within these walls, and its heart lies just beyond this door. But beware, for the way is barred not by lock or key, but by wit and wisdom.\"\n\n*The old man gestures towards the door, where intricate runes glow faintly. He begins to speak in a rhythmic, almost melodic tone.*\n\n**Riddle:** \"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?\"\n\n*The old man's eyes twinkle with a hint of challenge, awaiting your response.*\n\n**Answer:** An echo",
        "As you step cautiously through the shadowy corridors of the cursed fortress, you suddenly come upon a shimmering barrier of energy blocking your path. Out of the darkness, a hunched figure emerges, shrouded in tattered robes. Its eyes glimmer with an ancient, otherworldly light.\n\n\"Ah, a bold adventurer dares to tread these forsaken halls,\" the figure rasps, its voice echoing eerily. \"I am Zalthor, the keeper of this threshold. Only those who unravel my riddle may pass. Listen well, Paladin Kalle Carlsten, for this test will reveal if your wits are as sharp as your blade.\"\n\nThe figure pauses for a moment, then begins reciting the riddle:\n\n**Riddle:** I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?  \n**Answer:** An echo."
